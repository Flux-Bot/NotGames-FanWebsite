            <p>As soon as the clock reaches the end of it's timer - all owners of Not For Broadcast will get this bonus chapter as a free update (if Steam allows…).</p>

            <p>Us lot at the dev team will also be going live on the hour with insightful behind the scenes stories, sober commentary and live gameplay of the chapter. Well… maybe just the last one. We’ll be joined by eight very special guests you may recognise from the National Nightly News - a few politicians, the odd couple of interviewees, and maybe two anchormen, if you’re lucky.</p></span>

            <p>Hello you lovely chaps you - we know it feels like just yesterday we released our game into the wild, but today actually marks the four month anniversary of Not For Broadcast’s launch! Soon it’ll be calling us all dada and staying up past bedtime playing NotCoD.</p>

            <p>To celebrate this milestone, we wanted to share with you a mini documentary on what the NotGames offices looked like on Launch Day, all that time ago</p></span>
